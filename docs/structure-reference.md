# Structure reference: Fresha client app

Source: `STRUCTURE REFERENCE/` (2 screen recordings, 147s and 13s, plus 2 screenshots) of the Fresha client app booking a hair salon in Kumasi.
Rule for this project: **take the structure and flow from Fresha, the look (fonts, colours, patterns, motion) from Makro (`design-reference.md`), and the content from Franz Qlodin.** Every Fresha logo is replaced with the Franz Qlodin logo.

---

## 1. App shell
- **Floating bottom tab bar:** a white pill with a soft shadow and 4 tabs (Home · Search · Activity · Profile). The active tab gets a rounded grey highlight and a coloured icon; the Profile tab shows the user's initial in a circle.
- Large page titles ("Activity") with a round search button top-right. On scroll, the title collapses into a sticky header that keeps the filter chips.
- Every screen shows **skeleton loaders** (grey blocks in the shape of the layout) before content.

## 2. Screens seen, in order

### Activity tab
- Filter chips: **Appointments (7)** (active = black fill), Gift cards, Memberships
- Section headers **Upcoming / Past**
- Row: square venue thumbnail · bold venue name · `Tue, 15 Sept 2026 at 09:30` · `GHS 60 • 1 item` · outline **Rebook** pill
- Empty state: small illustration · "No gift cards" · one-line explanation · outline **Search venues** button

### Profile tab
- Big name + "Personal profile" + avatar circle
- **Wallet balance** card (bright gradient) with an outline "View wallet" button

6. Team: round avatars with rating badges, name, role

### Booking flow (full-screen modal, ← back and × close on every step)
| Step | Structure |
|---|---|
| 1 Select services | Big title · sticky category chips + list button · service cards with **＋**; the selected card gets a coloured border and check · a floating "1 selected service ↑" pill when the selection scrolls out of view · sticky bar **`GHS 60 / 1 item • 30 mins` + Continue →** |
| 2 Select professional | "For you" (last seen) · "All professionals": **Any professional – maximum availability** · professional cards (photo, rating, View profile, Select) |
| 3 Select date and time | Professional dropdown chip (opens a bottom sheet) · calendar button (opens a month-view bottom sheet) · **horizontal date strip** (selected filled, unavailable greyed) · "Pick a time" list of slot rows; changing the date shows a loader in the slots before the list appears |
| 4 Review and confirm | Venue card (photo, name, stars, address) · date + time range + duration · service lines · Total · Discounts and benefits [Add] · Cancellation policy · Important information · Comments or requests [Add] · sticky **Total + Confirm** |
| 5 Success | Confirm button → **3-dot loader** → **full-screen animated gradient with ✓ "Appointment confirmed"** (≈1.5s) → dissolves into the booking detail |

A push notification arrives right after, from the Fresha app with its logo: "Your appointment is booked for tomorrow… complete a short form".

### Booking detail
- Hero photo with the venue name; collapses on scroll into a white app bar "← Venue name"
- **Status badge:** Cancelled (red) / Action required (yellow)
- Big title **"Tomorrow at 09:30"** + duration
- **Action banner** (yellow card): "Complete the consultation form before your appointment · Complete now →"
- Actions card (tinted icon squares): Add to calendar · Get directions · Send message · Venue details. Past or cancelled bookings show Book again · Send message · Venue details.
- Overview card: service · "30 mins with **Baffour**" · Total
- **Forms** list: form name + "Complete before 15 Sept 2026" (orange) + chevron
- More details: Cancellation policy card with **Reschedule appointment** / **Cancel appointment** rows · Important info
- Getting there: map, written directions ("Opposite …, first floor") and "Get directions"
- Booking reference at the bottom
- Sub-flows:
  - **Add to calendar** is a bottom sheet (Google / Other calendar)
  - **Get directions** is a popover (Apple Maps / Google Maps)
  - **Send message** opens a chat screen (venue header plus a composer with attach and send)
  - **Cancel** is a bottom sheet: "Are you sure you want to cancel?" + booking card + "Not sure? Contact directly [Call]" + Go back / **Yes, cancel** (red) → gradient "Appointment cancelled" → detail with Cancelled badge → push notification

## 3. Interaction and motion patterns
- Skeleton → content crossfade on every load
- Flow steps push in from the right; the booking flow opens as a full-screen sheet sliding up; bottom sheets slide up over a dimmed backdrop, with the page behind scaling back slightly
- A collapsing hero header becomes a solid app bar; section tabs highlight the section in view
- Sticky bottom action bars on every flow step and detail page
- Selection: border + check pop; selected date fills
- Buttons show a 3-dot loader while an action is running
- Success and cancel screens: full-screen moving gradient + ✓ + big type, then dissolve
